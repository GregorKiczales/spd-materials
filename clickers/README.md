	
We have clickers during most but not all lectures in 110. Most of them are
based on recall of pre-lecture work. These happen as soon as lecture
starts. They are marked for correctness. In that way the clickers, worth 15%,
incent students to do the pre-lecture work and show up on time for class.
When students do poorly on a pre-lecture work question we do not spend time
on it. In that way we don't reward people for not being ready.

A small number of the questions are harder and/or are based on the work we are
doing during a lecture.  We use the clicker approach to ask those questions, so
that we can discuss student response.  We also award only participation for -
participation only not correctness.
