;; Design a function that generates a summoning charm. For example: 
;;
;;    (summon "Firebolt") should produce "accio Firebolt"
;;    (summon "portkey")  should produce "accio portkey"
;;    (summon "broom")    should produce "accio broom"
;;
;; See http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Summoning_Charm for background on
;; summoning charms.
;; 
;; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.

;; Follow the HtDF recipe and leave behind a commented out version of the stub.
