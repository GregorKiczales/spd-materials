;; Complete the design of a function that takes a list of weather data
;; and produces the sum total of rainfall in millimeters on days where
;; the average temperature was greater than 15 degrees Celsius.
;;
;; The function that you design must make at least one call to 
;; built-in abstract functions (there is a very nice solution that
;; composes calls to three built-in abstract functions).

;; If you would like to use the real daily weather data from Vancouver
;; from 10/3/1987 to 10/24/2013, 
;; place the weather.ss file in your current directory and uncomment
;; the following definition and add the given check-expect to your
;; examples.

;; (define WEATHER-DATA
