;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@problem 1)
;;
;; You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends 
;; 100 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from 
;; 100 kilometers to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.
;;
;; Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent. 
;; Call it RocketDescent.  Use a mixed data itemization to clearly
;; distinguish the case of when has shutdown and the journey is over. 
;;



;; =================
;; Functions:

(@problem 2)
;;
;; Design a function that will output the rocket's remaining descent distance 
;; in a short string that can be broadcast on Twitter. 
;; When the descent is over, the message should be "The rocket has landed!".
;; Call your function rocket-descent-to-msg.
