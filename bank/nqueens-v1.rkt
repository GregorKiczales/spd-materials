(@problem 1)
;; This version has data definitions, signature, purpose, tests and a couple
;; helpers.


;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@htdd Position)
;; Position is Natural
;; interp. positions on the board
;;         if    N is the number of queens
;;         then  (sqr N) is the number of positions on the board
;;         so    this number should be in [0, (- (sqr N) 1)]
(define P1 0)        ;upper left corner of board
(define P2 (- 16 1)) ;lower right corner of 4x4 board


(@htdd Board)
;; Board is (listof Position)  up to N elements long
;; interp. the positions of the queens that have been placed on the board
(define BD1 empty)           ;no queens placed
(define BD2 (list 0))        ;one queen in upper left corner
(define BD3 (list 14 8 7 1)) ;a solution to 4x4 puzzle 



;; =================
;; Functions:

;; NOTE about following function. It could have been designed with N as a
;; top-level constant and all the locally defined functions as top-level
;; functions. But doing it the way we have done below, makes it easy to make
;; the top-level nqueens function consume N which is kind of nice.  The
;; trampoline starts the actual search out by calling fn-for-bd with an empty
;; board.

(@htdf nqueens)
(@signature Natural -> Board or false)
;; produce first found solution for n queens of size N; or false if none exists
