;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@problem 1)
;; Design a data definition to represent a list of booleans.
;; Call it ListOfBoolean. 






;; =================
;; Functions:

(@problem 2)
;; Design a function that consumes a list of boolean values and produces true 
;; if every value in the list is true. If the list is empty, your function 
;; should also produce true. Call it all-true?
