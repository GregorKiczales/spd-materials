;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@problem 1)
;;
;; You are designing a program to track a rocket's journey as it descends 
;; 100 kilometers to Earth. You are only interested in the descent from 
;; 100 kilometers to touchdown. Once the rocket has landed it is done.
;;
;; Design a data definition to represent the rocket's remaining descent. 
;; Call it RocketDescent.  Use a mixed data itemization to clearly
;; distinguish the case of when has shutdown and the journey is over. 
;;

(@htdd RocketDescent)
;; RocketDescent is one of:
;; - Number
;; - false
;; interp. false if rocket's descent has ended, otherwise number of kilometers
;;         left to Earth, restricted to (0, 100]
