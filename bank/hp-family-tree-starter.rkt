;; In this problem set you will represent information about descendant family 
;; trees from Harry Potter and design functions that operate on those trees.
;;
;; To make your task much easier we suggest two things:
;;   - you only need a DESCENDANT family tree
;;   - read through this entire problem set carefully to see what information 
;;     the functions below are going to need. Design your data definitions to
;;     only represent that information.
;;   - you can find all the information you need by looking at the individual 
;;     character pages like the one we point you to for Arthur Weasley.


(@problem 1)
;; Design a data definition that represents a family tree from the Harry Potter
;; wiki, which contains all necessary information for the other problems.  You 
;; will use this data definition throughout the rest of the homework.


(@problem 2)
;; Define a constant named ARTHUR that represents the descendant family tree for
;; Arthur Weasley. You can find all the infomation you need by starting 
;; at: http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Arthur_Weasley.
;;
;; You must include all of Arthur's children and these grandchildren: Lily, 
;; Victoire, Albus, James.
;;
;;
;; Note that on the Potter wiki you will find a lot of information. But for some
;; people some of the information may be missing. Enter that information with a 
;; special value of "" (the empty string) meaning it is not present. Don't
;; forget this special value when writing your interp.


(@problem 3)
;; Design a function that produces a pair list (i.e. list of two-element lists)
;; of every person in the tree and his or her patronus. For example, assuming 
;; that HARRY is a tree representing Harry Potter and that he has no children
;; (even though we know he does) the result would be:
;;
;; (list (list "Harry" "Stag")).
;;
;; You must use ARTHUR as one of your examples.


(@problem 4)
;; Design a function that produces the names of every person in a given tree 
;; whose wands are made of a given material. 
;;
;; You must use ARTHUR as one of your examples.
