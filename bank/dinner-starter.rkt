;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@problem 1)
;; You are working on a system that will automate delivery for 
;; YesItCanFly! airlines catering service. 
;; There are three dinner options for each passenger, chicken, pasta 
;; or no dinner at all. 
;;
;; Design a data definition to represent a dinner order. Call the type 
;; DinnerOrder.





;; =================
;; Functions:

(@problem 2)
;; Design the function dinner-order-to-msg that consumes a dinner order 
;; and produces a message for the flight attendants saying what the
;; passenger ordered. 
;;
;; For example, calling dinner-order-to-msg for a chicken dinner would
;; produce "The passenger ordered chicken."
