;; You are asked to contribute to the design for a very simple New Year's
;; Eve countdown display. You already have the data definition given below. 
;; You need to design a function that consumes Countdown and produces an
;; image showing the current status of the countdown.

;; Data definitions:

(@htdd Countdown)
;; Countdown is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - Natural
;;  - "complete"
;; interp.
;;    false           means countdown has not yet started
;;    Natural         means countdown is running and how many seconds left
;;                    in [1, 10]
;;    "complete"      means countdown is over
