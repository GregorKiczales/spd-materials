;; This project involves the design of a program to solve the n queens puzzle.
;;
;; This starter file explains the problem and provides a few hints you can use
;; to help with the solution.
;;
;; The key to solving this problem is to follow the recipes! It is a challenging
;; problem, but if you understand how the recipes lead to the design of a Sudoku
;; solve then you can follow the recipes to get to the design for this program.
;;  
;;
;; The n queens problem consists of finding a way to place n chess queens
;; on a n by n chess board while making sure that none of the queens attack each
;; other. 
;;
;; The BOARD consists of n^2 individual SQUARES arranged in n rows of n columns.
;; The colour of the squares does not matter. Each square can either be empty
;; or can contain a queen.
;;
;; A POSITION on the board refers to a specific square.
;;
;; A queen ATTACKS every square in its row, its column, and both of its
;; diagonals.
;;
;; A board is VALID if none of the queens placed on it attack each other.
;;
;; A valid board is SOLVED if it contains n queens.
;;
;;
;; There are many strategies for solving nqueens, but you should use the
;; following:
;;  
;;   - Use a backtracking search over a generated arb-arity tree that
;;     is trying to add 1 queen at a time to the board. If you find a
;;     valid board with n queens produce that result.
;;
;;   - You should design a function that consumes a natural - n - and
;;     tries to find a solution.
;;    
;;    
;;    
;; NOTE 1: You can tell whether two queens are on the same diagonal by comparing
;; the slope of the line between them. If one queen is at row and column
;; (r1, c1) and another queen is at row and column (r2, c2) then the slope of
;; the line between them is: (/ (- r2 r1) (- c2 c1)).
;; If that slope is 1 or -1 then the queens are on the same diagonal.
