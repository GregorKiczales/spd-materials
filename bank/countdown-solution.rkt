;; Consider designing the system for controlling a New Year's Eve
;; display. Design a data definition to represent the current state 
;; of the countdown, which falls into one of three categories: 
;;
;;  - not yet started
;;  - from 10 to 1 seconds before midnight
;;  - complete (Happy New Year!)


;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@htdd Countdown)
;; Countdown is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - Natural
;;  - "complete"
;; interp.
;;    false           means countdown has not yet started
;;    Natural         means countdown is running and how many seconds left
;;                    in [1, 10]
;;    "complete"      means countdown is over
