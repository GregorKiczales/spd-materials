(define-struct photo (location album favourite))
;; Photo is (make-photo String String Boolean)
;; interp. a photo having a location, belonging to an album and having a
;; favourite status (true if photo is a favourite, false otherwise)
(define PHT1 (make-photo "photos/2012/june" "Victoria" true))

;; Functions:

(@problem 1)
;; Design a function called to-frame that consumes an album name and a list of 
;; photos and that produces a list of only those photos that are favourites and 
;; that belong to the given album. You must use built-in abstract functions
;; wherever possible.
