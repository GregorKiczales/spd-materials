;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@problem 1)
;; You work in the Human Resources department at a ski lodge. 
;; Because the lodge is busier at certain times of year, 
;; the number of employees fluctuates. 
;; There are always more than 10, but the maximum is 50.
;; 
;; Design a data definition to represent the number of ski lodge employees. 
;; Call it Employees.






;; =================
;; Functions:

(@problem 2)
;; Now design a function that will calculate the total payroll for the quarter.
;; Each employee is paid $1,500 per quarter. Call it calculate-payroll.
