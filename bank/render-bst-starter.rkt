;; INVARIANT: for a given node:
;;     key is > all keys in its l(eft)  child
;;     key is < all keys in its r(ight) child
;;     the same key never appears twice in the tree

(@problem 1)
;; Design a function that consumes a bst and produces a SIMPLE 
;; rendering of that bst. Emphasis on SIMPLE. You might want to
