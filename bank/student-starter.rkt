;; =================
;; Data definitions:

(@problem 1)
;; Design a data definition to help a teacher organize their next field trip. 
;; On the trip, lunch must be provided for all students. For each student, track
;; their name, their grade (from 1 to 12), and whether or not they have
;; allergies.






;; =================
;; Functions:

(@problem 2)
;; To plan for the field trip, if students are in grade 6 or below, the teacher 
;; is responsible for keeping track of their allergies. If a student has
;; allergies, and is in a qualifying grade, their name should be added to a
;; special list. Design a function to produce true if a student name should be
;; added to this list.
