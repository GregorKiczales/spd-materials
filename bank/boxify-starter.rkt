;; Use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design a function that
;; consumes an image, and appears to put a box around it. Note that you can do
;; this by creating an "outline" rectangle that is bigger than the image, and
;; then using overlay to put it on top of the image. 
;; For example:
;;
;; (boxify (ellipse 60 30 "solid" "red"))
;; should produce the image found in this link:
;; https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/bank/boxify.png
;;
;; Remember, when we say DESIGN, we mean follow the recipe.
