;; YOU MUST CONSULT THE m02-grade-standing-documents.rkt
;; starter file which has documents you will need.  But do all your
;; actual work in this starter file.
;;
;; We want to design a program to operate on submitted grades. For now 
;; JUST FOCUS ON THE % GRADE AND STANDING.  AFTER designing a representation
;; for this information, you must design two functions:
;;
;;  - A fn that consumes grade/standing and produces true if
;;    the grade/standing is >= 90.  Call this function excellent?
;;
;;  - A fn that consumes grade/standing and produces strings
;;    like  "90%"  "75%" "P" "F". Call this function grade->string


(@problem 1)
;; Data definition goes here:

;(@htdf excellent?)

(@problem 2)
;(@htdf grade->string)
