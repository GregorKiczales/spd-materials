Design a function that consumes two lists of numbers. Each list
is already sorted in increasing order. The function should produce
the merged list sorted in increasing order.
Show the cross product of type comments table, the simplification,
and the correspondence between table cells and cond cases.

For example:

  (merge (list 2 3 5) (list 1 4 6)) --> (list 1 2 3 4 5 6) 
  
As a reminder, here is a data definition for a list of numbers To 
save space later we are calling it LON instead of ListOfNumber
|#

;; Data Definitions:
;;
;; NOTE: IN 2-ONE-OF PROBLEMS ONLY, WE USE LON FOR ListOfString.
;;

(@htdd LON)
;; LON is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons Number LON)
;; interp. a list of numbers
(define LON1 empty)
(define LONA (list 2 3 5))
(define LONB (list 1 4 6))

;; Function:

(@htdf merge)
(@signature LON LON -> LON)
;; merge two lists of sorted numbers into ascending order; preserves duplicates
;; CONSTRAINT: both lists must be already sorted in ascending order
(check-expect (merge empty empty) empty)
(check-expect (merge empty (list 2 3 5)) (list 2 3 5))
(check-expect (merge (list 1 4 6) empty) (list 1 4 6))
(check-expect (merge (list 1 4 6) (list 2 3 5)) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6))
(check-expect (merge (list 2 3 5) (list 1 4 6)) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6))
(check-expect (merge (list 1 2 3) (list 4 5 6)) (list 1 2 3 4 5 6))
(check-expect (merge (list 1 2 3) (list 1 2 3)) (list 1 1 2 2 3 3))
