    <h2>Lecture 13</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>Before lecture 13, please watch the following videos from
      Module 8: From Examples 1, and From Examples 2. Also be sure to
      answer the associated online questions.</p>

    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>

    <p>The plan for lecture is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Design an abstract fn from examples, and rewrite the
      original functions to call it. This particular problem will involve a
      little more complexity than the pre-lecture examples.
	
Develop the signature for abstract functions using type inference.
Design an abstract function based on a template.
Write entirely new functions that use abstract functions in their function definition. (Some of this will be homework.)
For extra practice using built-in abstract functions:

    <p>The starters for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="110-intro.pdf">110-intro.pdf</a></li>
      <li><a href="m01-primitives-starter.rkt">m01-primitives-starter.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m01-functions-starter.rkt">m01-functions-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>Congratulations on finishing lecture 1!  Remember to ask questions anytime something isn't clear in lecture. Forming questions is a key part of learning, so forming and asking questions in lecture is learning!</p>

    <p>To complete the lecture first review primitives-starter (the solution is below).</p>

    <p>Then work through all the sections of Module 1A: BSL.  Once you are done you can complete the functions-starter file and work through it. Remember that reading the solution file before working hard to solve it yourself is the worst way to try and learning this material - you have to struggle through it some yourself before looking at the solution or else you spoil the learning opportunity the problem gives you.</p>

    <p>The solutions for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m01-primitives-solution.rkt">m01-primitives-solution.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m01-functions-solution.rkt">m01-functions-solution.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>BEFORE the next lecture be sure to go to it and do the pre-work it asks for.</p>

    <p>Again, welcome to 110.  If you work hard and stay caught up we believe you will enjoy discovering programming and a knowing a systemtic approach to solving difficult design problems.</p>
    
    <p>Be sure to complete the before lecture section of <a href="lecture-02.html">Lecture 3</a> before that lecture.</p>
