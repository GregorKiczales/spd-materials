#|
Design the function has-path? that consumes BinaryTree and Path.
The function should produce true if following the path through the
tree leads to a node. If the path leads to false, or runs into false
before reaching the end of the path the function should produce false. 
Show the cross product of type comments table, the simplification,
and the correspondence between table cells and cond cases.
