;; A BST (Binary Search Tree) is one of:
;;  - false
;;  - (make-node Integer String BST BST)
;; interp. false means empty BST
;;         key is the node key
;;         val is the node val
;;         l and r are left and right subtrees
;; INVARIANT: for a given node:
;;     key is > all keys in its l(eft)  child
;;     key is < all keys in its r(ight) child
;;     the same key never appears twice in the tree

PROBLEM: Complete the data definition.  Include example constants for nodes 27,
42, and 10. Also write a template. As of module 6A you are no longer required
to have a @dd-template-rules tag.  But you must still follow the rules!
