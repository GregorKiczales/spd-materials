    <h2>Lecture 07</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>To prepare for this lecture First be sure that you are totally
      comfortable with HtdW. If you need any help with this ask on
      Piazza or go to office hours.</p>

    <p>Then watch the "Reference Rule Part 1" and "Reference Rule Part
      2" videos. This is a rare case where we mean just watch, not work
      through. But, do pay close attention; you will need to have watched it
      in order to be able to work through the example we will do next
      time. The clicker question will probably be from this unit!</p>

    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>In this lecture we will design a world program in which the
      world state is a list of elements, for which we will have a
      separate data definition.</p>
      
    <p>By the end of the lecture&ndash;including the post-lecture work&ndash;you should be able to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Design data definitions to represent an arbitrary number of
	compound information elements.</li>
      <li>Design a world program using such a data definition.</li>
      <li>Identify an application of the reference rule and follow the
	rule to properly design a separate helper function.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The starters for this lecture are:</p>

      <li><a href="m04-raining-eggs-v-2-5-starter.rkt">m04-raining-eggs-v-2-5-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>NOTE: Starter files with numbers in their names show a
      progression of intermediate states of solving the problem.</p>

	
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>


    <p>Here is the solution for this lecture:</p>

    </ul>

    <p>Once again, congratulate yourself on the hard work in lecture
      today. Ask yourself whether you could have understood much less
      written that program at the start of the term. So even if you
      struggled with lecture you should feel proud of how much you have
      learned. And you can use the lecture as a measure of getting ready
      for the midterm.</p>

    <p>This lecture is the last one in module 4. To complete module 4
      you should:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Rework Today'S Example, paying particular attention to how
	render-eggs and place-egg work (see below).</li>
      <li>Work through the 3 reference rule videos as needed to be
	sure you are clear on this kind of problem.</li>
      <li>Use the practice problems and if needed the problem bank for
	extra help in solidifying your understanding of these
	problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are three key points in this lecture that you want to be 
      sure you understand:</p>

    <p>(1) The information we needed to represent consisted of an
      arbitrary number of non-atomic entities (i.e. eggs). To do
      that we end up with two types: one for the individual entities
      (eggs), and one for the arbitrary number of them (the
      list).</p>
    
    <p>The type comments have self-reference and reference arrows,
      and the templates have corresponding natural recursion and
      natural helper arrows.</p>

    <p>(2) The natural helper in the template means that if a function
      based on the template (next-eggs, render-eggs) needs to
      perform some operation on the referred to type, then it must
      call a single function, with that type in its signature, to
      perform that operation.</p>

    <p>So next-eggs needs to call a new function next-egg to advance
      the egg, rather than calling all three of egg-x egg-y egg-r.</p>

    <p>(3) One of the key issues is figuring out what arguments the
      natural helper will receive. Specifically does the natural
      helper receive the result of the natural recursion as an
      argument or not. In other words, is the helper in combination
      position or contribution position. Consider these two
      cases:</p>

    <pre>
(check-expect (next-eggs (cons (make-egg 100 200 300) 
                               (cons (make-egg 400 500 600) 
                                      empty))) 
              (cons (make-egg 100 (+ 200 FALL-SPEED) (+ 300 SPIN-SPEED)) 
                    (cons (make-egg 400 (+ 500 FALL-SPEED) (+ 600 SPIN-SPEED)) 
                          empty))) 
    </pre>

    <p>In this case we can see that cons is in the combination
      position.  That's because it accepts the result of the natural
      recursion as an argument (2nd in this case).  Make-egg is in the
      contribution position. The make-egg part of the example needs
      access to two or more of the fields, so the natural helper will
      take care of the make-egg functionality (contribution of the
      first) and cons is the combination.</p>

    <pre>
(define (next-eggs loe) 
  (cond [(empty? loe) empty]
        [else 
         (cons (next-egg (first loe)) 
               (next-eggs (rest loe)))]))
    </pre>

    <p>Now consider render-eggs:</p>
    
    <pre>
(check-expect (render-eggs (cons (make-egg 100 50 25) 
                                 (cons (make-egg 10 20 30) 
                                       empty))) 
              (place-image (rotate 25 YOSHI-EGG) 100 50 
                           (place-image (rotate 30 YOSHI-EGG) 10 20 
                                        MTS)))
    </pre>

    <p>In this case the call to place-image is in the combination
    position (it gets the result of the natural recursion as an
    argument). Place-image also needs access to the results of
    multiple field selectors. So the place-image functionality goes
    into the helper and the helper is in combination position.</p>

    <pre>
(define (render-eggs loe) 
  (cond [(empty? loe) MTS] 
        [else 
         (place-egg (first loe) 
                    (render-eggs (rest loe)))]))
    </pre>

    <p>Be sure that you can see that place-egg consumes the result of the
      natural recursion, but next-egg does not. That happens because in
      tock-eggs we don't need to know anything about the details of the
      egg to know where to put it in the list. It always gets consed
      onto the front. So cons doesn't need to look inside the egg, it
      just puts it on the front.</p>

    <p>But in render-eggs we do need to know the details of the egg to
      know where to put it on the image (on the result of the natural
      recursion). So place-egg needs to consume the egg as well as the
      result of the natural recursion.</p>

    <p>The videos on edX cover this in great detail. Be sure to work
      through them and this example until you are confident you
      understand what happened here. Use the forums and/or office hours
      and DLC hours for extra help.  Here also is another way of
      presenting this same difference:</p>

    <pre>
(define (next-eggs loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) empty]
        [else
         ;generic composition: cons
         ;egg specific contribution: uses x, y and r
         ;---> combination in list fn, contribution entirely in helper
         ;(cons (make-egg (egg-x (first loe))
         ;                (+ (egg-y (first loe)) FALL-SPEED)
         ;                (+ (egg-r (first loe)) SPIN-SPEED))
         (cons (next-egg (first loe))
               (next-eggs (rest loe)))]))


(define (render-eggs loe)
  (cond [(empty? loe) MTS]
        [else
         ;egg specific composition: place-image needs x, y
         ;egg specific contribution: uses r
         ;---> combination is in helper, also does contribution work
         ;(place-image (rotate (egg-r (first loe)) YOSHI-EGG)
         ;             (egg-x (first loe))
         ;             (egg-y (first loe))
         ;             (render-eggs (rest loe)))
         (place-egg (first loe)
                    (render-eggs (rest loe)))]))
    </pre>

    <p>Note that we are using single semi-colon comments because these
    are not the kind of comment that we would normally leave in
    code. They are temporary.</p>
