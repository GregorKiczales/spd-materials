    <h2>Lecture 08</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>

    <p>In this lecture we will briefly go through the Naturals module 5a, including module overview and natural numbers.</p>

    <p>We will not cover the Parlor Trick in lecture, but you may find
      that entertaining to watch - it will help you understand that the
      primitive data in BSL are data definitions like any others. They
      represent information. You could design them if you wanted to.
      But it will also show you pretty clearly that not all data
      definitions are equally good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then we will jump into module 5b helpers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Before this lecture, please work through the Introduction and
      Function Composition sections in the Helpers module.

    </ul>

    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>This lecture began with a quick look at designing functions
      that consume a natural and produce a result of that size.  The
      example consumed n and produced n+1 nested boxes.  You should
      finish that starter file yourself as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Up until today we had only one helper function rule &ndash; the
      reference rule. But now we have three more: function
      composition, operate on arbitrary sized data, and knowledge
      domain switch. Of these four rules, the first three are
      unambiguous &ndash; you need to follow them every time. The
      knowledge domain switch is more subjective, but you can usually
      tell pretty clearly when it is in play.</p>

    <p>To review this lecture try to re-work the entire example from
      scratch. Keep a diagram next to you as you go about what functions you
      are working on, and why you split each function into helpers. Work
      methodically and know where you are in the recipe at each step.</p>
      

    <p>At this point you are responsible for the entire course up
      through the Helpers module.</p>
