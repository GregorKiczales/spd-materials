    <h2>Lecture 10&mdash;Mutual reference and mutual recursion</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>Before lecture 10, please work through the videos in Module 6b:
      Mutually Recursive Data and Templating Mutual Recursion and
      complete the online questions for this module.</p>

    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>Today we covered what may seem like a complex concept &mdash; Mutual
      Reference. When Working with types that have mutual reference we
      are operating on data far more complicated than a few weeks
      ago.</p>

    <p>But here's where all the work you have done so far really
      starts to pay off. We can use our notation for types, we can
      form templates for those types, we understand reference,
      self-reference and now mutual reference, we know about positions
      in templates, particularly base and combination positions, we
      have guidelines for forming tests for functions. And we know how
      to trust the natural recursions!</p>

    <p>That means that we can write each of the functions in a mutual
    recursion without having to think through all the calls. Which
    makes these functions not much harder than functions on lists from
    module 4.</p>

    <p>So the one really new thing we learned in this module really
      was that when we design functions on mutually referential data we
      group the signature/purpose/examples/definitions differently. The
      rest was just HtDF!</p>

    <p>We also learned the backtracking template, which gets added
    into our type based templates to do a backtracking search over a
    tree. We will see this again and again as we go forward.</p>

    <p>To review what you learned today:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Review the data definitions for the regions structure. To test your knowledge, try constructing the DD for the Unit hierarchy without looking at the starter.</li>
      <li>Try redoing the functions we did in lecture from scratch.</li>
      <li>Then complete the remaining functions in the starter file. If you get stuck, do the steps described above to help yourself understand what to put in the ... section. Use the videos in Module 6b for help.</li>
      <li>Go to the Module 6b videos, download the starters and work ahead on the problem. Use the video to see if what you did was correct! Do NOT just watch the videos &mdash; this will not help you.</li>
      <li>After you work through the backtracking search video do the backtracking problem in today's starter file.</li>
