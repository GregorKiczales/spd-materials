;; 
;; One of the most important ideas in software is abstraction. What abstraction
;; means is that we:
;;   - recognize that some functionality seems to be repeated/common
;;   - package that common behaviour in a reusable way
;;   - so that future (and current) uses of that common behaviour
;;     can be easier to develop, easier to understand, more reliable etc.
;; 
;; So abstraction is a verb:
;;   - to recognize the common functionality and package it
;; 
;; and a noun:
;;   - the packaged up common behaviour.
;; 
;; 
;; We have already seen one form of abstraction - templates.

;; That's very powerful.  As we have said before, expert thinking is

;; constructs.
;; 
;; 
;; There's another way to go about it, which works in fewer cases, but
;; provides much greater abstraction when it does work.  The idea is to
;; desing a function that captures the reusable behaviour, with special
;; arguments corresponding to each of the ... in the template.
;; 
;; Again, abstractions packaged as functions are very powerful when they
;; work for a problem; but they don't work for all problems. So after 
;; module 8 we will use both kinds of abstraction as appropriate.

Develop a FUNCTION DEFINITION for an abstract function to simplify the 
following two functions. Complete your work by re-defining the original
functions to use the new abstract function. You do not need to do the
signature, purpose or tests for the new abstract function yet.

;; produce true if every number in lon is greater than x.
(check-expect (all-greater? empty 0) true)

Now complete the design of the andmap2 abstract function.

First move the definition from above below here.  Then work backwards
through the recipe to add @template-origin, check-expects, purpose,
@signature, and @htdf tag.  Use type inference to produce the signature.
Be sure to use the (list <Type>) form for every list type from now on.

purpose and tests.
