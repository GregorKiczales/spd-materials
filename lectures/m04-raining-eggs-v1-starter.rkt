;; In the raining eggs program, the program starts with an arbitrary number of
;; eggs that are falling down straight and spinning. When you click mouse a
;; new egg appears where you click. Mario stands in the scene, hoping no eggs
;; drop on his head. (All eggs magically pass Mario.) Eggs disappear off the
;; bottom of the screen. When the space key is pressed, all eggs disappear
