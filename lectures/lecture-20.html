    <h2>Lecture 20&mdash;Tail Recursion 2</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>Be sure to carefully review the material from
      <a href="lecture-19.html">Lecture 19</a>.  Expect lecture 20 to
      build on that material and expect clicker questions based on
      that material.</p>
    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>

    <p>The first part of this lecture does not use a starter file. For
      the second part of the lecture the starter file is:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="m11-maze-4-way-find-path-starter.rkt">m11-maze-4-way-find-path-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>In this lecture we built on the expert thinking skills you have
    been developing throughout the course. We saw how to read a
    complex function, and use our knowledge of the templates and how
    accumulators work to slice it up into different aspects of its
    behaviour (colors). We reconstructed the accumulator types and
    invariants and used that to understand the behaviour of 2
    functions.</p>

    <p>One function traversed the tree using standard recursion; the
    other uses tail recursion.  Both functions maintained an
    accumulator that was consed onto in each recursive call.  But
    because of the difference in how the two kinds of recursion
    traverse the graph, the two accumulators accumulate different
    values event though the update code for both looks the same. It is
    important to understand the different values these accumulators
    take on, and is important to follow our naming convention: We call
    it path in the ordinary recursion, and visited in the tail
    recursion.</p>


    <p>We then moved on to module 11 and jumped into the maze solver
      again.  We updated the program to be able to move in all four
      directions but found that it ran forever. That happens because
      the program is now traversing a directed graph, not a tree, and
      directed graphs can have cycles, which can lead our solver to go
      around and around in circles forever.<p>
          
    <p>Be sure to complete the before lecture section
    of <a href="lecture-21.html">Lecture 21</a> before that
    lecture.</p>
