    <h2>Lecture 18&mdash;Accumulators</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>

    <p>There is no pre-work for this lecture. Use this time to review
      the concepts we have covered previously.</p>
    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>The starters for this lecture are:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="m10-sequencep-starter.rkt">m10-sequencep-starter.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m10-bstp-starter.rkt">m10-bstp-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>Today we introduced accumulators. Accumulators are used in
      recursive functions to accumulate information from prior
      recursive calls. While all accumulators have this basic
      functionality, it is also useful to think of accumulators as
      falling into one of three categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Accumulators that directly accumulate the result so far
	(RSF). In these accumulators the base (or trivial) case of the
	recursion typically produces the value of the accumulator
	directly.</li>

      <li>Accumulators that preserve important context from prior
	recursive calls. These accumulators differ from RSF
	accumulators in that while they form an important part of the
	function, and can contribute to the result, they are typically
	not the direct result of the function.</li>

      <li> (We will see these later.) Accumulators that maintain a
	worklist of elements that remain to be visited in a tree or
	graph, or that maintain a tandem worklist of accumulator
	values to restore when the corresponding element is
	visited.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>In lecture we did one example of using a single accumulator
      when traversing a list and one of using two accumulators while
      traversing a tree.</p>

    <p>As always, review the lecture by practicing what we did in
      class. You can also use the videos from the Accumulators module up
      to but not including Tail Recursion.</p>
