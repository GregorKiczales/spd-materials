    <h2>Lecture 14</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>

    <p>Before lecture 14, you should:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use the <a href="m08-raining-eggs-refactor-starter.rkt">m08-raining-eggs-refactor-starter.rkt</a> as additional practice for use built-in abstract function problems.</li> AFTER you have worked it through, consult the solution to check your work -  <a href="m08-raining-eggs-refactor-solution.rkt">m08-raining-eggs-refactor-solution.rkt</a> 

      <li>On edX work through the Fold Functions pt. 1 unit.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>It is crucially important that you be totally comfortable with
    all of the Abstraction module up through Fold Functions pt. 1
    before lecture because we will build on it significantly to make
    much more complicated programs get much much shorter.</p>

    <h3>During Lecture</h3>

    
    <p>The starters for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m08-abstract-fold-definition-starter.rkt">m08-abstract-fold-definition-starter.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m08-abstract-fold-usages-starter.rkt">m08-abstract-fold-usages-starter.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m08-abstract-fold-complications-starter.rkt">m08-abstract-fold-complications-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>The first thing to do is feel good for working through today's
      lecture - it is a difficult one. Feel good even if some of it
      was confusing! We are now past where many intro programming
      courses go. So don't be surprised if you need a couple of passes
      through today's material for it to truly sink in.</p>

    <p>In terms of material we covered in module 8 it is very
      important to distinguish the different kinds of things we have
      done with abstract functions:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	We designed abstract functions, in two different ways:
	<ul>
	  <li>from examples (filter2, map2, andmap2)</li>
	  <li>from a template (foldr2, fold-course)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>As part of the design of these problems we used <em>type
	    inference</em> to infer the signature of the function based on
	  it's definition. These functions end up having a template
	  origin like (listof X) or Course and (listof Course) for
	  example.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	We used abstract functions to write the definition of other
	functions we designed. In these cases the template origin of our
	function is either use-abstract-fn or fn-composition and
	use-abstract-fn.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Whenever you are working with an abstract functions problem it
      is very important to be sure which of the two you are doing -
      designing the abstract function, or using an abstract
      function. Note that the last step of any abstraction from
      examples is to rewrite the original function definition to use
      abstract function - but that is a separate and final phase of
      the abstraction frome examples.</p>

    <p>As always, the best way to review today's material is to rework
      all three starters.</p>
