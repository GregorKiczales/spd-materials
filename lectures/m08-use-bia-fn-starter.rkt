Complete the design of each of the following functions.  You MUST use the 
template origin provided, which is always either use-abstract-fn or
fn-composition use-abstract-fn.  To help you learn how to write functions
that use built-in abstract functions we  provide the template or other
suggestions in some of the problems.

When choosing built-in abstract functions yourselves remember:

 - map always produces a list of the same length as it's argument.
   In general the elememts of the result list are not the same as
   the argument list.

    (map add1 (list 1 2 3)) -> (list 2 3 4))
   
 - filter produces a list of all, some or none of the elements in its 
   argument. The elements of the result list are elements of the 
   argument list.

    (filter odd? (list 1 2 3)) -> (list 1 3)
   
 - foldr can produce any kind of value at all. It folds a list of
   values, one at a time, down onto a result value:

    (foldr + 0 (list 1 2 3)) -> (+ 1 (+ 2 (+ 3 0))) -> 6

 - andmap and ormap produce boolean values

 - buildlist produces a list with the same number of elements as its
   argument
