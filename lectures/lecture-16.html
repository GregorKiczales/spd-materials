    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>Today's program had everything. Representing information,
      generative search, template blending, simple templating, using
      built-in abstract list functions. Pretty much everything we've
      done. It was also a great example of how what we have learned
      breaks big problems into a lot of much smaller problems. As just
      one example, when we are coding valid-next-positions, and we
      realize "ok, some of the positions are valid and I want to do just
      those, then using what we know about templating we can very
      quickly write this:<p>

      <pre>
(@template-origin use-abstract-fn)      

(define (next-valid-positions p)
  (filter valid? (list ...)))</pre>

      <p>Then we create the wish list entry for valid? and then go on to complete the design of valid?.</p>

      <p>The big idea today was the remarkable insight that we can
	solve a problem like finding our way through a maze by
	generating a tree of possible routes and searching that tree for
	a solution.  It's not a tree that existed when we started, it is
	a tree we <em>generate</em> as we go &mdash; thus it is a
	generative recursion.</p>

    <p>A key step of the design was to form a template that blends:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>arbitrary arity tree</li>
      <li>generative recursion</li>
      <li>try-catch</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Which set us up for doing a backtracking search over a
    generated arbitrary-arity tree.</p>
      
    <p>Once we had our solve function in place, all that was left to
    do was HTDF to complete the wishlist entries.</p>

    <p>To review today's material we recommend you rework the key steps of the problem:</p>

    <ul>

      <li>Be sure you are comfortable with the domain analysis
      picture, the tree, the changing information and how next states
      in the tree are generated.</li>

      <li>Redo the template blending of arbitrary arity tree and
	generative recursion and try-catch from scratch and write out the
	wishlist entries.</li>

      <li>Review the code for the wish list functions.</li>

      <li>Re-write the terminationa argument for solve.</li>
      
      </ul>

    <p>You can also review this material by working slowly through the
      Sudoku videos on edX (all of them). They are long, but that is
      because they develop the example in full. Doing this will be
      another excellent practice for long problems, which you want to
      get as much practice as you can with at this point in the term.</p>
