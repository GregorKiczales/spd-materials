    <h2>Lecture 15&mdash;Generative Recursion</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>Before lecture, please work through videos in edX module 9a and answer associated online questions.</p>
    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>

    <a>In this lecture we are going to start working with a new kind
      of recursion.  We have been doing structural recursion, in which
      each recursive call happens at the natural place where the data
      was previously built up. But now we are going to start working
      with <em>generative recursion</em>. In generative recursion,
      rather than recursive calls receiving a sub-piece of the
      existing data, the recursive calls receive newly generated data
      as their argument. This introduces a couple of wrinkles we will
      need to learn to cope with.</a>

    <p>The starters for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m09-genrec-qsort-starter.rkt">m09-genrec-qsort-starter.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m09-genrec-simple-cantor-starter.rkt">m09-genrec-simple-cantor-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>qsort was pretty incredible in terms of how many design
      techniques we have learned were used in the function design:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HtDF (always!)</li>
      <li>check-expects are examples to understand the function before they are tests</li>
      <li>generative recursion</li>
      <li>templating</li>
      <li>using local to give a name to an intermediate value</li>
      <li>built in abstract list functions</li>
      <li>wishing for a locally defined function</li>
    </ul>
	    
    <p>All of that in one example!</p>

    <p>Another thing that the qsort design highlights is how important
      it is to remember to let the recipe show you what you are ready to
      do at any one time. This is crucial, if you one step at a time do
      small parts of the whole design that you are ready to do, then
      eventually you will actually have solved the whole problem!</p>
      
    <p>This is especially important in something like quicksort that
      seems initially confusing. Do the examples, that's not so
      hard. Then you can do the trivial case. Then maybe elaborate an
      example. And so on.</p>

    <p>With regard to the second problem, note that the posted
    solution is just to the simple cantor function. You can use that
    to build up the world program if you want. (Good practice!)</p>

    <p>As always, a great way to review the lecture is to replay the
      entire design of quicksort.</p>

    <p>At this point you are responsible for all of module 9a. Review
      the videos, do the practice problem etc.</p>

    <p>The solutions for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m09-genrec-qsort-solution.rkt">m09-genrec-qsort-solution.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m09-genrec-simple-cantor-solution.rkt">m09-genrec-simple-cantor-solution.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
