Design a function that consumes two lists of strings and produces
true if the first list is a prefix of the second, meaning that 
the first list matches, 1 for 1, the beginning of the second list.

For example:

  (prefix=? (list "a" "b") (list "a" "b" "c")) --> true
  (prefix=? (list "a" "b") (list "b" "c"))     --> false
  (prefix=? (list "a" "b") (list "a" "b"))     --> true
  (prefix=? (list "a" "b") (list "a"))         --> false

  
As a reminder, here is a data definition for a list of strings. To 
save space later we are calling it LOS instead of ListOfString.

;; Data Definitions:

(@htdd LOS)
;; LOS is one of:
;;  - empty
;;  - (cons String LOS)
;; interp. a list of strings
(define LOS1 empty)
(define LOS2 (cons "a" (cons "b" empty)))

;; Function:
