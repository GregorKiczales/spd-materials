;; Design a function that renders a region and its subregions as
;; nested boxes. The rendering does not have to be pretty, but it must somehow
;; reflect the coloring, the labels and the weights.  The border function below
;; will be helpful to you.
;;
;; To save time, the starter has part of the solution done.  You need to
;; fully understand all the check-expects, and then go on to @template-origin,
;; @template, and the final function definitions. But be sure you are able to
;; do the provided steps yourself. You will need to do them on later problems,
;; and of course problem sets, labs, and exams.  
;; 
;; Remember, trust the natural recursionS, and think about contributions and 
;; combinations.
