;; NOTE:

;; Your AUTOGRADER RESULTS will be found at the following address:
;;
;;    https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/handback/12345678/
;;
;; Where you must replace 12345678 with your UBC student number.  You will need
;; to login with your CWL and CWL password.
;;
;;  For lecture starters you can get some feedback from the autograder during
;;  lecture, provided you can submit a file that passes the Check Syntax button
;;  at the top right of the Dr Racket window.
;;
;;  Especially at first it can be hard to get all your ( ) and "  " properly
;;  balanced, and so you might not be able to pass the Check Syntax.  If that
;;  happens then first start by getting the gist of the problem right.  You
;;  can (and should) go back after lecture to work the problem until you
;;  get autograder feedback saying it is 100% correct.
;;
;;  But for problem sets, labs, and exams you should not submit your file if
;;  Check Syntax produces an error.  Fix the error first, then submit.

(@problem 1)
;; 
;; Remember that the equation for the lengths of the sides in a
;; right triangle is:
;; 
;;   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
;; 
;;   c = sqrt ( a^2  +  b ^2) 
;; 
;; Write an expression to compute the length of side c when a is 3
;; and b is 4.  The name of the primitive that computes the square
;; root of a number is sqrt.  We want an expression that makes it
;; clear how the result was computed from 3 and 4 using the
;; equation above.  Do not just put 5.
;;







(@problem 2)
;; 
;; The background for the Canadian Flag (without the maple leaf) is two
;; red bands on either side of a white band. Write an expression to produce that
;; background. If you want to get the details right, officially the overall flag
;; has proportions 1:2, and the band widths are in the ratio 1:2:1.
