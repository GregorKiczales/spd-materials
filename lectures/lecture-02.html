    <h2>Lecture 02&mdash;How to Design Functions (HtDF recipe)</h2>

    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>

    <p>Before beginning Lecture 02 you should have worked through all sections of Module 1a
      (Beginning Student Language).  Being comfortable with the foundational BSL material will
      enable you to focus on the new material in this module.  Remember that when we say work
      through what we mean is that you should:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Do some combination of stopping the videos and working ahead, then checking yourself
	against the video; or typing along with the video.</li>
      <li>Answer all of the edX questions, and when you get one wrong take the time to understand
	what is the correct answer and why.</li>
      <li>Remember that no one ever got better at program design (or tennis, or skiing, or playing
	the violin, or drawing or...) by watching someone else do it.</li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>

    <p>This lecture introduces the most important element of the
      course&mdash;the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe.  This is a
      systematic process for designing a well-thought out, consistent,
      and well tested function.  By the end of the course you will use
      this recipe hundreds of times, and each time you will learn a
      little more about it.</p>

    <p>By the end of the lecture&mdash;including the post-lecture
      work&mdash;you should be able to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use the HtDF recipe to systematically design simple
	functions operating on numbers, strings, and images.</li>
      <li>Complete all parts of the HtDF recipe for such
	functions.</li>
      <li>Use the metadata tags (@htdf, @signature, @template-origin
	and @template) in the design.</li>
      <li>Begin to be comfortable with the fact that program design
	often involves having to find and use new resources.</li>
      <li>Begin to be comfortable with the fact that program design
	inherently involves making and then fixing mistakes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The starter file for this lecture is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m01-htdf-starter.rkt">m01-htdf-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>Here is the solution file for this lecture. (Don't look at it
      until you have tried to solve all the problems yourself!)</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m01-htdf-solution.rkt">m01-htdf-solution.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Here's how you should approach reviewing what we have covered
      so far. You will probably have done a lot of what is below
      already, so incorporate what you have already done into how you
      adopt the plan below.</p>
    
  <ul>
    <li>First redo all the problems from today's lecture. Do that BEFORE you look at the posted
      solutions above.</li>
    
    <li>Also work through any problems we did not complete in lecture.</li>
    
    <li>Then work through the videos in 1b HtDF as need be. Definitely
      work through the HtDF slow video, and then work through the
      other example videos as you feel you need to so that you are
      comfortable with HtDF. Try getting the starter and working
      through the problem on your own, and then when you don't know
      what to do watch the video up to that point to help you. Pause
      and restart a lot as you get help and then work through pieces
      on your own! (Be sure to answer all the questions in all the
      sections though.)</li>
    
    <li>Finally work the practice problems from the
      <a href="../bank/index.html">Problem Bank</a>. You can get help
      on these in office/DLC hours from an instructor or a TA (all
      office hours info is on the Schedule page or post a question
      on Piazza.</li>
    
    <li>Then you will be ready to complete problem set 1. Be sure you
      complete problem set 1 by the deadline.</li>
    
  </ul>
  
    <p>You will be responsible for knowing all material covered in the
      Beginning Student Language (1a) and How to Design Functions (1b)
      edX modules. That means all the sections, the videos and all the
      questions interspersed in those videos.</p>

    <p>And always remember, it's a learn by doing discipline. A prior
      learner said:</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      This is a bit like learning to make bread, or carve wood, or
      fold origami. Knowing what to do and how to do it comes through
      practice, practice, and more practice. Because we'll constantly
      need to re-apply our gained knowledge in different
      circumstances, practice is the only way to really gain a deep
      understanding of how these concepts work for a variety of
      problems.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Finally, quick notes: Any time you have a question about the
    course, it is likely answered in one of two places: on Piazza or
    in the Syllabus. So, go back to the Discussion board and the
    Syllabus regularly!</p>
    
    <p>Be sure to complete the before lecture section
      of <a href="lecture-03.html">Lecture 3</a> <em>before</em>
      that lecture.</p>
