    <h2>Lecture 01</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>If possible, before lecture 1, please go to the Setup page, which you can access from <a href="https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/links.html">https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/links.html</a> and follow the directions for setting up DrRacket.</p>
    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>
    
    <a>This lecture has 3 parts:</a>
    
    <ul>
      <li>An overview of the course content, organization, how you will learn, policies, and how to do well.</li>
      <li>Primitive data and operations in the Beginning Student Language. Evaluation rules.</li>
      <li>Function definition and evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>By the end of the lecture - including the post-lecture work - you should be able to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Write expressions using primitive functions and data.</li>
      <li>Write a simple function definition.</li>
      <li>Write out the step-by-step evaluation of expressions and simple functions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The starters for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="110-intro.pdf">110-intro.pdf</a></li>
      <li><a href="m01-primitives-starter.rkt">m01-primitives-starter.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m01-functions-starter.rkt">m01-functions-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>Congratulations on finishing lecture 1!  Remember to ask questions anytime something isn't clear in lecture. Forming questions is a key part of learning, so forming and asking questions in lecture is learning!</p>

    <p>To complete the lecture first review primitives-starter (the solution is below).</p>

    <p>Then work through all the sections of Module 1A: BSL.  Once you are done you can complete the functions-starter file and work through it. Remember that reading the solution file before working hard to solve it yourself is the worst way to try and learning this material - you have to struggle through it some yourself before looking at the solution or else you spoil the learning opportunity the problem gives you.</p>

    <p>The solutions for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m01-primitives-solution.rkt">m01-primitives-solution.rkt</a></li>
      <li><a href="m01-functions-solution.rkt">m01-functions-solution.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>BEFORE the next lecture be sure to go to it and do the pre-work it asks for.</p>

    <p>Again, welcome to 110.  If you work hard and stay caught up we believe you will enjoy discovering programming and a knowing a systemtic approach to solving difficult design problems.</p>
    
    <p>Be sure to complete the<em>Before Lecture</em> section of <a href="lecture-02.html">Lecture 3</a> before the next class.</p>
