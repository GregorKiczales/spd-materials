;; Spider, goes down the screen with thread

#|
PROBLEM:

Revise this program so that when the program starts the spider moves down the 
screen, but pressing the space key changes its direction. It should also change
direction when it hits the top or bottom edge.

 - First "reverse-engineer" the domain analysis from the program.
 - Then revise the domain analysis for this new behaviour.
 - Then systematically work your way through the program in the same
   order as HtDW says revising the program to match the new analysis.

   You will need to CHANGE the definition of the Spider type

   When you change a type (a data definition) you need to systematically
   go check on every function that consumes or produces that type to update
   it to the new definition.

Then you can extend the program to make the spider appear to wiggle as it
moves. Unlike in Cowabunga you should represent the state of the wiggle
explicitly as a field in the world state.
