    <h2>Lecture 23&mdash;Summary and Looking Ahead</h2>
    
    <h3>Before Lecture</h3>
    
    <p>Be sure to work through and review the material from
      lecture <a href="lecture-22.html">Lecture 22</a> so that you can
      ask questions about that material if you have any.</p>
    
    <h3>During Lecture</h3>
    
    <a>In this lecture we will do three things:</a>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Step back and take a broader look at systematic design and what you have learned.</li>
      <li>Look at how what we have learned can be useful in other languages.</li>
      <li>Take a brief look at near and long term next steps now that you have taken 110.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The starter for this lecture is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m12-accs-and-python-loops-starter.rkt">m12-accs-and-python-loops-starter.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
	
    
    <h3>After Lecture</h3>

    <p>The solutions for this lecture are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="m12-python-loop-w-acc.py">m12-accs-and-python-loops-solution.rkt</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The best way to prepare for the final is to work through
      practice problems without looking at solutions. It's even better
      if you do that during office hours, when a member of the staff can
      give you feedback and hints if you get stuck.</p>
    
    <p>Finally&mdash;thanks for spending the term with us. We hope
      that you will feel you learned a lot and that it was worth the
      investment you made in spending your time on this material.</p>
