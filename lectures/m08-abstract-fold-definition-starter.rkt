#|

The first step in designing an abstract fold function is always the same -
copy the encapsulated templates, and add one parameter for each set of ...

By convention the parameters that stand for functions go first, the parameters
that stand for base values go after that, and the data always goes last. We
have done this first step for you below.

Complete the design of the following abstract fold function for Course.
Note that we have already given you the actual function definition and the
template tag. You must complete the design with a signature, purpose,
function definition and the two following check-expects:

  - uses the fold function to produce a copy of C110
  - uses the fold function to count the total number of courses,
    in the C110 tree, including C110
