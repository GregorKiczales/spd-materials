Santana Woodstock
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaaT_HRb4GU&list=RDJaaT_HRb4GU&start_radio=1
6:16, must start at x3:55

Metaphor for what it takes to do well in the course - in university generally.
 
At the beginning Congas set up a beat, Santana says keep that beat going.

Over the next while the band does amazing things over that beat.

--> That's what you have to do in 110. Set up a beat, a rythm, a set of work habits. Work with the material every day. Work through the whole problems.

By the end of the term you will be able to do amazing things.

Dolores O'Riordan would have been just 22 here. It's just a reminder to me of how much of the brilliance in the world comes from young people. (And of the tragedy of substance abuse that kills so many people.)

When you were young, did your school ever have fund raising events?
Maybe the parents organized something. Maybe some kind of show, or
outdoor event, or concert.

In the Bay Area, in the 80s, when Neil Young still lived in La Honda,
his kid's school needed to raise funds.  But when you're Neil Young,
asking a few of your friends to come play means a whole different
thing.  That was the bridge concerts.

Saw a bunch of great music there, including this year that David Bowie
was there.
