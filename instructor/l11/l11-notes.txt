00 introduction             [present]
   what type definitions do

05 prefix=? [present]
   show syntax of table slide
   do table in Dr. R, 
   use filled in table slide for markup

merge [class]
 - interrupt for empty->l2 simplification
 do table in Dr R


has-path?   [class]
as time allows
if 15 or so left
 - tell them to focus on table
 - give 5 minutes
 - then talk through table slide

** Preface

Show where we are on Design Recipes page table

** Intro

Have worked hard to learn systematic approach to program design.

Grounded in theory and research.

Little look today at some of the kinds of things this enables in the future.

Just banging-on-the-keyboard vs. engineering and science.

semi-automatic code generation has always been the future of SD
with more/less automatic in waves
 LLMs -> "generative" -> actually higher-level > higher-level > assembly > machine code >


** Setup

we know that type comments like:

LOS is one of:
 - empty
 - (cons String LOS)

means that a template like:

(define (fn-for-los los)
  (cond [(empty? los) (...)]
        [else
         (... (first los)
              (fn-for-los (rest los)))]))

will proceed through the list to the end, and that if we fill in the base
case and combination/contribution positions correctly the result will be
correct.

It's worth taking a second to think about what we have.  We can write
the type comment, and because it is grounded in theory we AUTOMATICALLY
get the rest and we know it is correct.

This is going to let us do something pretty fantastic.  We are going to
show that by correctly simplifying type comments we can produce correct
simplified code, and that simplifying type comments is easier than
simplifying code.  This is an example of something engineers love. The
ability to simplify/optimize at a model level rather than down in the
details of the code.  Much more powerful and complex examples of this
await you in other courses, grad school, and/or industry.
