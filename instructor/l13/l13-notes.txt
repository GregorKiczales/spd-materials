clicker happens at beginning of map2 problem


NOTE: Do not drop problem 1 from functions starter. We tried that it was a big mistake! It means
that students didn't see the massaging before abstraction example.


----
Today is hard work. Second half of 110 we are going to cover more.



from-examples-starter

problem 1 - extract andmap2 with massaging [present]

problem 2 - students complete andmap2 later (annotate starter) 

problem 3 - complete filter2, given fn definition, learn type inference [present, signature interactive]

problem 4 - complete signature for map2  [class]

-40

use-bia-fns starter

quick survey map, filter, foldr [present]

circles (map _ lon) [present step-by-step template and complete]

sum-larger-than [present template, class]

explain build-list [present]

problem 2, complete design of filter2, present up to @signature, then interactive

add origin
add tests, need base, need 2 preds,
introduce listof, type params
inference
  (_ _ -> _)  number of params              
  (( -> __) _ -> _)  what's a function
  ((_ -> _) _ -> _) how many args
  ((_ -> Boolean) _ -> _) if wants a Boolean answer
  ((_ -> Boolean) (listof _) -> _) first, rest
  ((_ -> Boolean) (listof _) -> (listof _)) cons, empty
  ((X -> Boolean) (listof X) -> (listof _)) first  goes to p
  ((X -> Boolean) (listof X) -> (listof X)) first goes to cons
